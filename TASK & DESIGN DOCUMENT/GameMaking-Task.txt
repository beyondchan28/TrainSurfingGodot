need:
- storyline
- UI
- cinematic (storyboard) harus estetik (reward)
- lighting harus sama, antara game dan animasi cutscene
- nambah anggota
- audio

Done :
- movement
- camera
- train/cars movement
- mechanics design
	* Friend following the player(X)
	* walking, running, crouching, climbing, unclimbing
	* Use jackets
	* CCTV and Workers
	* flashlight
- character design
	* workers, need to a bit different than the main character.
	* the shape and height should different.
	* the texture needs to be a little unique and recogniseable.
- game level design
	* Night
	* need to tweaking the world light and the flashlight


to-do:
- assets: Character(X), Environment(buildings(X), road, park(X), trees(X))
- Gonna make the character and use free assets for the rest of the needs
- Start making the game level after got all the asset needs.
- train tracks and the train assets.
- the fkcing grass is not place properly.
- detail under the bridge.


on-progress:
- Main character, teksture(X), rig(x) dan animating(walk(X), run(X), crouch(X), climb, unclimb).
- Other assets.
- Make the level design.
- Program the mechanics: walking(X), running(X), crouching(X), and climbing(X).
- Clean the code
- train station part (window(X), texture(X), details(X)).


Note:
- for the level logic, use seperate node and script to build it
- the detail for the land jst using texture (not suitable, bad idea).
- Jst start with the "necessary assets", then do the details
- making the road-park first then the details
- park lamp, benches, bushes and then tress
- road width + sidewalk
- need an animation after climb, 

- the movement is not suitable for the gameplay i think, its better to use the RE style

- FORGET TO FCKING APPLY THE SCALE OF THE ARMATURE, FFS AM I NEED TO REDO ALL THE ANIMATIONS ?
- make sure the scale between characters and environment is correct
